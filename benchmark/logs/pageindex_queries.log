It outlines the directory structure, including key components such as:\n\n1. **Core Layer (`langchain-core`)**: Contains base abstractions, interfaces, and protocols, which are foundational but not directly exposed to users.\n2. **Implementation Layer (`langchain` and `langchain_v1`)**: Includes concrete implementations and high-level public utilities, with `langchain_v1` being actively maintained and `langchain-classic` being legacy.\n3. **Integration Layer (`partners/`)**: Provides third-party service integrations, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and local model support, while noting that some integrations are maintained in separate repositories.\n4. **Testing Layer (`standard-tests/`)**: Contains standardized integration tests for partner services.\n5. Additional utilities and tools, such as document chunking (`text-splitters`), model configuration profiles (`model-profiles`), command-line tools (`cli`), and CI/CD workflows (`.github/`).\n\nThe document also highlights the purpose of each layer and provides guidance on navigating related repositories for external integrations.",

Local development uses editable installs: `[tool.uv.sources]`\n\nEach package in `libs/` has its own `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.\n\n```bash\n# Run unit tests (no network)\nmake test\n\n# Run specific test file\nuv run --group test pytest tests/unit_tests/test_specific.py\n```\n\n```bash\n# Lint code\nmake lint\n\n# Format code\nmake format\n\n# Type checking\nuv run --group lint mypy .\n```",
