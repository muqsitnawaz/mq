I found the documentation standards. Here's the answer:

## LangChain Documentation Standards

LangChain uses **Google-style docstrings** with the following requirements:

### Docstring Format Example

```python
def send_email(to: str, msg: str, *, priority: str = "normal") -> bool:
    """Send an email to a recipient with specified priority.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        to: The email address of the recipient.
        msg: The message body to send.
        priority: Email priority level.

    Returns:
        `True` if email was sent successfully, `False` otherwise.

    Raises:
        InvalidEmailError: If the email address format is invalid.
        SMTPConnectionError: If unable to connect to email server.
    """
```

### Key Rules

1. **Types go in function signatures, NOT in docstrings** - all Python code must include type hints and return types
2. **Do NOT repeat default values** in the docstring unless there is post-processing or it is set conditionally
3. **Focus on "why" rather than "what"** in descriptions
4. **Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions**
5. **Keep descriptions concise but clear**
6. **Use American English spelling** (e.g., "behavior", not "behaviour")
7. **Mark experimental features** with docstring warnings using MkDocs Material admonitions (`!!! warning`)

### Simpler Example (from code quality section)

```python
def filter_unknown_users(users: list[str], known_users: set[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Single line description of the function.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        users: List of user identifiers to filter.
        known_users: Set of known/valid user identifiers.

    Returns:
        List of users that are not in the known_users set.
    """
```

ANSWER: LangChain uses Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections. Types go in function signatures (not docstrings), default values should not be repeated in docstrings, and descriptions should focus on "why" rather than "what". Use American English spelling.
