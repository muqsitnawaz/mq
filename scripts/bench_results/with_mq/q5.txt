## Documentation Standards for LangChain Code

LangChain uses **Google-style docstrings** with an `Args` section for all public functions.

### Example of Proper Docstring Format

```python
def send_email(to: str, msg: str, *, priority: str = "normal") -> bool:
    """Send an email to a recipient with specified priority.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        to: The email address of the recipient.
        msg: The message body to send.
        priority: Email priority level.

    Returns:
        `True` if email was sent successfully, `False` otherwise.

    Raises:
        InvalidEmailError: If the email address format is invalid.
        SMTPConnectionError: If unable to connect to email server.
    """
```

### Key Rules

1. **Types go in function signatures, NOT in docstrings**
2. **Don't repeat defaults** in docstrings unless there's post-processing or conditional setting
3. **Focus on "why" rather than "what"** in descriptions
4. **Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions**
5. **Keep descriptions concise but clear**
6. **Use American English spelling** (e.g., "behavior", not "behaviour")

ANSWER: LangChain uses Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, and Raises sections. Types belong in function signatures only, not docstrings. Focus on "why" over "what", document all parameters/returns/exceptions, use American English spelling.
