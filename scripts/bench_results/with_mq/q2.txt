Now I have all the information needed about the langchain-anthropic package.

## Installing and Using langchain-anthropic

### Installation

```bash
pip install langchain-anthropic
```

### What is it?

This package contains the LangChain integration for Anthropic's generative models (Claude).

### Documentation Resources

- **API Reference**: https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_anthropic/
- **Guides & Tutorials**: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/anthropic

### Basic Usage

After installation, you can use Anthropic's models with LangChain:

```python
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic

# Initialize the model
llm = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-opus-20240229")

# Use it
response = llm.invoke("Hello, how are you?")
```

You'll need to set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable or pass it directly to the constructor.
