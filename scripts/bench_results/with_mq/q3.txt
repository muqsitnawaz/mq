Now I have all the information needed to answer the question.

## Testing Requirements for LangChain Contributions

Based on the documentation in `AGENTS.md`, here are the testing requirements:

### Core Requirement
**Every new feature or bugfix MUST be covered by unit tests.**

### Test Types
- **Unit tests**: Located in `tests/unit_tests/` - no network calls allowed
- **Integration tests**: Located in `tests/integration_tests/` - network calls permitted

### Testing Framework
- Uses `pytest` as the testing framework
- Test file structure should mirror the source code structure

### Test Coverage Checklist
- Tests must fail when your new logic is broken
- Happy path is covered
- Edge cases and error conditions are tested
- Use fixtures/mocks for external dependencies
- Tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)

### Standard Tests for Integrations
For integration packages (like chat models, embeddings, etc.), LangChain provides `langchain-tests` package with standard test classes you should inherit from:
- `ChatModelUnitTests` for unit tests
- `ChatModelIntegrationTests` for integration tests

This ensures consistent coverage across all integrations.

ANSWER: Every new feature or bugfix MUST be covered by unit tests. Tests go in tests/unit_tests/ (no network calls) or tests/integration_tests/ (network calls permitted). Coverage must include: happy path, edge cases, error conditions, deterministic behavior (no flaky tests), and tests must fail when the new logic is broken. For integrations, use langchain-tests standard test classes.
```
