The `mq` tool is not installed. However, I already have the answer from the CLAUDE.md content provided in the system context. The commit standards are clearly documented there.

## Commit Standards for LangChain Monorepo

The commit messages should follow **Conventional Commits format**. Key rules:

1. **Format**: `type(scope): description`
2. **Case**: All lowercase except for proper nouns/named entities
3. **Scope**: Required for all commits - no exceptions
4. **Types**: Refer to `.github/workflows/pr_lint` for allowed types

### Examples:
```txt
feat(langchain): add new chat completion feature
fix(core): resolve type hinting issue in vector store
chore(anthropic): update infrastructure dependencies
```

Note: Even for the main `langchain` package, the scope must be included (e.g., `feat(langchain):` not just `feat:`).

ANSWER: LangChain uses Conventional Commits format: type(scope): description. All lowercase (except proper nouns), scope is always required. Examples: feat(langchain): add feature, fix(core): resolve issue, chore(anthropic): update deps.
```
