I now have the commit standards information. Let me provide the answer.

## Commit Standards for LangChain Monorepo

The LangChain monorepo follows **Conventional Commits** format for PR titles and commits. Here are the key requirements:

### Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Rules
1. **Lowercase** - All commit/PR titles should be lowercase, except for proper nouns/named entities
2. **Scope is required** - All PR titles must include a scope with no exceptions
3. **Types and scopes** - Refer to `.github/workflows/pr_lint` for allowed types and scopes

### Examples
```
feat(langchain): add new chat completion feature
fix(core): resolve type hinting issue in vector store
chore(anthropic): update infrastructure dependencies
```

Note: Even the main package (`langchain`) requires a scope, e.g., `feat(langchain)` not just `feat:`.

ANSWER: LangChain uses Conventional Commits format for PR titles. Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>. Rules: lowercase (except proper nouns), scope is always required. Types/scopes defined in .github/workflows/pr_lint. Examples: feat(langchain): add feature, fix(core): resolve issue.
```
