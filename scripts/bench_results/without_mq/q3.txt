I found the key information. Let me summarize based on the files I've read:

## Testing Requirements for LangChain Contributions

Based on the documentation in the repository:

### Key Testing Requirements (from `AGENTS.md`):

1. **Every new feature or bugfix MUST be covered by unit tests**

2. **Test Organization:**
   - Unit tests: `tests/unit_tests/` (no network calls allowed)
   - Integration tests: `tests/integration_tests/` (network calls permitted)
   - Testing file structure should mirror the source code structure

3. **Test Coverage Checklist:**
   - Tests fail when your new logic is broken
   - Happy path is covered
   - Edge cases and error conditions are tested
   - Use fixtures/mocks for external dependencies
   - Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)

4. **CI Requirements (from PR Template):**
   - Must run `make format`, `make lint` and `make test` from the root of modified packages
   - PRs will not be considered unless all three are passing in CI

5. **Framework:** `pytest` is used as the testing framework

6. **Standard Tests:** For partner integrations, use `langchain-tests` package which provides standard test base classes (`ChatModelUnitTests`, `ChatModelIntegrationTests`, etc.)

ANSWER: Every new feature or bugfix MUST be covered by unit tests. Test coverage must include: happy path, edge cases and error conditions, tests that fail when logic is broken, deterministic tests (no flaky tests), and use of fixtures/mocks for external dependencies. Unit tests go in tests/unit_tests/ (no network calls), integration tests in tests/integration_tests/ (network allowed). Tests must pass in CI via `make test`.
