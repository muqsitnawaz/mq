Now I have all the information needed. Let me compile the answer.

## Testing Requirements for LangChain Contributions

Based on the documentation, here are the testing requirements for contributing to LangChain:

### Core Requirement
**Every new feature or bugfix MUST be covered by unit tests.**

### Test Types
- **Unit tests:** Located in `tests/unit_tests/` - no network calls allowed
- **Integration tests:** Located in `tests/integration_tests/` - network calls permitted

### Test Coverage Checklist
The following criteria must be met:
1. Tests fail when your new logic is broken
2. Happy path is covered
3. Edge cases and error conditions are tested
4. Use fixtures/mocks for external dependencies
5. Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)
6. Test suite fails if new logic is broken

### Additional Requirements
- Use `pytest` as the testing framework
- Testing file structure should mirror the source code structure
- Run `make test` from the root of the package you've modified
- PRs will not be considered unless tests pass in CI (along with `make format` and `make lint`)

### For Integration Packages
Partner integrations should use the standard test library (`langchain-tests`) and create:
1. A unit test class inheriting from base classes (e.g., `ChatModelUnitTests`)
2. An integration test class inheriting from integration test base classes (e.g., `ChatModelIntegrationTests`)

ANSWER: Every new feature or bugfix MUST be covered by unit tests. Expected test coverage includes: (1) tests that fail when logic is broken, (2) happy path coverage, (3) edge cases and error conditions tested, (4) fixtures/mocks for external dependencies, (5) deterministic tests with no flakiness. Unit tests go in tests/unit_tests/ (no network), integration tests in tests/integration_tests/ (network allowed). Test file structure should mirror source code. For partner integrations, use langchain-tests standard test classes.
