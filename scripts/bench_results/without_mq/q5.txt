The AGENTS.md file contains all the documentation standards. Here's the answer:

## Documentation Standards for LangChain Code

LangChain uses **Google-style docstrings** with the following requirements:

### Key Rules:
1. **Types go in function signatures, NOT in docstrings**
2. Don't repeat default values in docstrings unless there is post-processing or conditional setting
3. Focus on "why" rather than "what" in descriptions
4. Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions
5. Keep descriptions concise but clear
6. Use American English spelling (e.g., "behavior", not "behaviour")

### Example of Proper Docstring Format:

```python
def send_email(to: str, msg: str, *, priority: str = "normal") -> bool:
    """Send an email to a recipient with specified priority.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        to: The email address of the recipient.
        msg: The message body to send.
        priority: Email priority level.

    Returns:
        `True` if email was sent successfully, `False` otherwise.

    Raises:
        InvalidEmailError: If the email address format is invalid.
        SMTPConnectionError: If unable to connect to email server.
    """
```

### Another Example (simpler function):

```python
def filter_unknown_users(users: list[str], known_users: set[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Single line description of the function.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        users: List of user identifiers to filter.
        known_users: Set of known/valid user identifiers.

    Returns:
        List of users that are not in the known_users set.
    """
```

### Additional Code Quality Standards:
- All Python code **MUST include type hints and return types**
- Use descriptive, self-explanatory variable names
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Mark experimental features with MkDocs Material admonitions (like `!!! warning`)

ANSWER: LangChain uses Google-style docstrings. Types go in function signatures (not docstrings), Args section documents all parameters, Returns section describes return values, and Raises section lists exceptions. Use American English, focus on "why" not "what", and keep descriptions concise. Example format shows single-line summary, optional context paragraph, then Args/Returns/Raises sections.
```
