I have all the information needed from the AGENTS.md file. Here's the answer:

## LangChain Documentation Standards

LangChain uses **Google-style docstrings** with Args sections for all public functions.

### Key Documentation Rules:

1. **Types go in function signatures, NOT in docstrings**
2. **Use Google-style docstrings** with Args, Returns, and Raises sections
3. **Focus on "why" rather than "what"** in descriptions
4. **Document all parameters, return values, and exceptions**
5. **Keep descriptions concise but clear**
6. **Use American English spelling** (e.g., "behavior", not "behaviour")
7. **Don't repeat default values** in docstrings unless there's post-processing or conditional logic

### Example of Proper Docstring Format:

```python
def send_email(to: str, msg: str, *, priority: str = "normal") -> bool:
    """Send an email to a recipient with specified priority.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        to: The email address of the recipient.
        msg: The message body to send.
        priority: Email priority level.

    Returns:
        `True` if email was sent successfully, `False` otherwise.

    Raises:
        InvalidEmailError: If the email address format is invalid.
        SMTPConnectionError: If unable to connect to email server.
    """
```

### Another Example (simpler function):

```python
def filter_unknown_users(users: list[str], known_users: set[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Single line description of the function.

    Any additional context about the function can go here.

    Args:
        users: List of user identifiers to filter.
        known_users: Set of known/valid user identifiers.

    Returns:
        List of users that are not in the known_users set.
    """
```

For experimental features, use MkDocs Material admonitions like `!!! warning` in the docstring.

ANSWER: LangChain uses Google-style docstrings with Args sections. Types go in function signatures (not docstrings), focus on "why" rather than "what", document all params/returns/exceptions, use American English. Example format includes a single-line summary, optional additional context, Args section (param: description), Returns section, and Raises section for exceptions.
